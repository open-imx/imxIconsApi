To explore which icons are available you can retrieve all IMX paths, ir directly fetch all mappings (optional filter them by a IMX path).
 
You can retrieve an SVG string or file based on a mapping, additionally we provide support for fetching URLs for the icons.

Different versions have different mappings, and we currently support IMX v1.2.4 and v5.0.0. 

**We have a Known issue: QGIS icons are not working at the moment.**

ImxIconsApi is part of the [Open-IMX](https://www.open-imx.nl) initiative.
